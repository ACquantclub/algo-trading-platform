"""
Pseudoname: ChÃ¢teau Petito (chateaupetito@yahoo.com)
Strategy Name: Momentum Risk Optimization

This is the strategy that perplexity: o3-mini
generated from a one-shot query with the following prompt:
"Given the description of the competition in 1a_2025_algo_case_packet and the training data and using any external information you can find as help, create an advanced strategy does as good as possible in the competition"
The model was given access to the pdf version of the case packet, the training data, and the ability to search for external resources (all 4 perplexity source categories were turned on).
